# Usman Tahir Qureshi
- I like to play guitar, sing and also write songs. I have written a few songs in Urdu language but haven't produced them yet.
* I like to play cricket, football (soccer) and go on hikes in the mountains where you could only camp for the night.
+ I like star gazing at night which is because of my interest in knowing more about our universe and what is out there.
